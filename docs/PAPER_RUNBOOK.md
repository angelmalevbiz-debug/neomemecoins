# Reproduce, run, reset and roll back PAPER

Use Python 3.12+ and Node 22+. This audit used Windows Python 3.14.8 and Node 24.21.0. Runtime JSON, private archives, recordings, virtualenv and generated build files are ignored by Git. Never commit account registries or credentials.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
npm ci
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/run_python_checks.py
npm run lint
npm run check:strategy
npm run build
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_quote_contract.py
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_pages_backend.py --output .runtime/pages-backend-check.json
```

Both Python suites use temporary state/audit/cache directories through the runner. Test imports do not load or overwrite the working account. No live execution path is enabled; `NEO_ENGINE_MODE=LIVE` fails at startup.

## Local PAPER dashboard and free HTTPS tunnel

The maintained Pages frontend can use the local PAPER services without Contabo. The local runtime is isolated under the ignored `.runtime/accounts` directory. It starts a $1,000 main PAPER account, nine separate $500 learning books, a shared market recorder, and a per-user gateway on loopback ports 8878/8879. It does not modify remote/server accounts.

```powershell
.\scripts\start_local_paper.ps1 -Action Start
.\scripts\start_local_paper.ps1 -Action Status
```

To repair only a missing tape process while verified main and gateway processes continue running, use `-Action StartMissing`. Stop all three gracefully and flush their state with `-Action Stop`; the command does not force-kill a service that is still stopping.

In a separate PowerShell window, expose only the loopback gateway and keep that window open:

```powershell
$neoPaperUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:8879'
& 'C:\Program Files (x86)\cloudflared\cloudflared.exe' tunnel --no-autoupdate --protocol http2 --url=$neoPaperUrl
```

Copy the `https://….trycloudflare.com` hostname into the GitHub repository variable `NEO_API_URL`, then rerun the Pages deployment workflow. The checked-in workflow reads that variable at build time. A Quick Tunnel is temporary and has no uptime guarantee; the computer, local PAPER processes, network, and `cloudflared` window must remain available. If the tunnel restarts with a different hostname, update `NEO_API_URL` and rerun Pages deployment. See Cloudflare's [Quick Tunnel documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/quick-tunnels/).

The browser gateway uses exact Pages-origin CORS and requires the normal Supabase bearer token for private state. `/user/health` and the shared `/state` diagnostic do not prove that the logged-in private dashboard works. Use the authenticated site to validate the account after deployment. PAPER actions only; no LIVE executor is exposed by this local service.

The read-only Pages/backend check deliberately returns a nonzero exit code if the public gateway's CORS origin or shared backend schema is still old. It does not log in, bypass private account authentication, reset accounts, or certify financial results. See [DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md](DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md) for the latest measured deployment boundary.

## Start a separate PAPER account

Set isolated paths and declared risk values before starting. The following creates a new $1,000 main account, with conservative explicit risk limits and independently funded $500 learning books. It changes no existing server account.

```powershell
$paperRoot = Join-Path (Get-Location) '.runtime/demo'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $paperRoot | Out-Null
$env:NEO_ENGINE_MODE='PAPER'
$env:NEO_MARKET_STATE_PATH=Join-Path $paperRoot 'state.json'
$env:NEO_MARKET_AUDIT_PATH=Join-Path $paperRoot 'audit.jsonl'
$env:NEO_LIVE_TAPE_PATH=Join-Path $paperRoot 'live_tape.json'
$env:NEO_TAPE_DB_PATH=Join-Path $paperRoot 'tape.sqlite'
$env:NEO_RISK_CACHE_DIR=Join-Path $paperRoot 'risk'
$env:NEO_PRICE_CHECK_DIR=Join-Path $paperRoot 'price-check'
$env:NEO_JUPITER_LOCK_PATH=Join-Path $paperRoot 'quote.lock'
$env:NEO_JUPITER_STAMP_PATH=Join-Path $paperRoot 'quote-stamp.txt'
$env:NEO_MAX_POSITION_RISK_USD='100'
$env:NEO_MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_PCT='40'
$env:NEO_MAX_DAILY_LOSS_USD='50'
$env:NEO_MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT='10'
.venv/Scripts/python.exe backend/live_tape.py
```

Run `backend/market_monitor.py` in another terminal with the same environment. Set `NEO_STRATEGY_LAB_PATH` and `NEO_STRATEGY_LAB_COMPACT_PATH` to isolated paths if running legacy Lab too. The main process launches its independent training worker and bounded writer. The worker has no provider client. Price/safety checks and tape must become valid before entries; UNKNOWN/DEGRADED data correctly stays WAIT. Start with an API budget appropriate to the actual authenticated provider plan.

Primary repository defaults retain a disabled daily cap (`0`), disabled drawdown cap (`0`), maximum full-loss capital $250 and exposure 100%; these are explicitly visible and are **not** the conservative runbook settings. New training default risk limits remain active. Do not silently change an existing account's limits.

`GET /state` includes `paper_training`: portfolio capitals/returns, open/completed trades, raw simulation versus unique observations/episodes, refusals, failure fees, queue drops/lag, last training, active version, history and control comparison. The live Pages build displays those fields.

## Recording and causal replay

The bridge coalesces only identical observation IDs in a bounded recent-ID cache, then writes accepted rows to `<account directory>/training/observations.jsonl`. It stores availability/source times, exact mint/pool, flow, safety/price provenance, main quote evidence and explicit model assumptions. It makes no per-experiment API request. The independent worker evaluates up to 100 complete rows per batch, atomically saves learner state with its byte-offset checkpoint, and resumes there after restart; the main bot never waits for this work. Queue drops remain explicit evidence gaps and block promotion. Copy recordings after flushing/stopping the producer, or use complete newline-terminated records only.

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/paper_training.py import --input .runtime/demo/training/observations.jsonl --output .runtime/datasets/market.jsonl
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/paper_training.py replay --input .runtime/datasets/market.jsonl --state .runtime/replay/training.json --snapshot .runtime/replay/snapshot.json
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/paper_training.py compare --state .runtime/replay/training.json
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/replay_main.py --input .runtime/datasets/market.jsonl --output .runtime/main-replay/report.json --state-dir .runtime/main-replay/account
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/compare_main.py --input .runtime/datasets/market.jsonl --output-dir .runtime/compare-real
```

Fresh output directories are required for primary comparisons. Replay sorts by actual availability and preserves observed timestamps; no sleep, provider calls or future features. Missing exact historical quote quantities cannot be substituted by current quotes or prices. Optional record-from-stdin command:

```powershell
Get-Content canonical-observations.jsonl | .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/paper_training.py record --output .runtime/recording.jsonl
```

Synthetic correctness reproduction uses `tests/fixtures/paper_gap_v9.jsonl`, not the real dataset paths. Financial evaluation needs recorded subsequent market data across enough independent days/episodes.

## Reset every PAPER account and restore

Explicit latest user authorization covers all PAPER accounts. Stop **all** main/per-user/training/Lab/Astra/paired writers before offline reset. The all-account operation enumerates the known registry/user state formats, preserves each starting balance (Fast Scalper $100, other legacy books normally $500), resets main/per-user $1,000 and nine training books $500 each, creates SHA256 archives and new sessions, and keeps raw market data. Unknown schemas abort before known-account changes. A multi-account reset is not one filesystem transaction; disk failure can leave a partial reset, so retain the output/archive manifests and recover from them.

Local example executed:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/paper_runtime.py reset-all --root .runtime/accounts --offline
```

On the existing Linux server, an administrator should stop the gateway and all its child engines as well as the independent services; confirm no writers remain. Service definitions in this repository locate the primary/private/Lab/Astra accounts under `/var/lib/neo-market` and paired experiments under `/var/lib/neo-lab-paired` (verify actual deployment overrides):

```bash
python3 scripts/paper_runtime.py reset-all --root /var/lib/neo-market --paired-root /var/lib/neo-lab-paired --offline
```

Existing `/control/reset` resets only the associated primary account; authenticated `/user/reset` resets only that person's account. Neither proves every private or legacy account has been reset. The shared remote account was successfully reset during this audit; all-account remote reset remains pending administrative host access. Avoid introducing an unauthenticated bulk reset endpoint.

Restore a particular checksum archive with stopped writers:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/paper_runtime.py restore --root .runtime/accounts --archive .runtime/accounts/archive/RESET_DIRECTORY --offline
```

Main and nested training archives are separate: restore each to its matching directory. Restore also archives the current files. Hash mismatch refuses replacement. For code rollback, select the prior reviewed commit and restore its matching saved PAPER account/config archive; do not reuse future-version state blindly. Training rollback is automatic within LEARNER and recorded in version history; it never changes production code.

A first frontend build correctly failed the old strategy hash guard before manifest update; it was an expected authorized-change guard failure. The final guard passed without deleting verification. The synthetic comparison dataset SHA256 is `5c1609a5768aff2bf4c06e7a9cdd5df529be67e5bd18407915c6d6f8095db363`. Raw archives and private runtime data remain local and excluded from Git.

The original repair was reviewed in PR #2 of the legacy repository. The maintained source was subsequently published to `angelmalevbiz-debug/neomemecoins` at `9634414e2ea109afd83b5f78e0277a6bc530f2d0`; its Pages run `37359080106` and PAPER regression run `37359080111` succeeded. The served HTML, JavaScript and CSS were checked against that run's exact artifact. The migrated regression result was 259 root tests plus 59 backend tests. These successful checks supersede the old account-lock/quota failures above for the maintained Pages site.

Production backend installation has not happened because no administrative host session is available. At 2026-10-05 19:07 UTC its gateway still allowed only the legacy Pages origin; the shared backend still reported `ORDER_FLOW_GOLD_SIGNAL_VERIFIED_V7` and had no `paper_training` object. Updating a web build cannot restart or update its Python services. The shared primary reset does not satisfy the requested all-account reset.
